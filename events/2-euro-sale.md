## FAQ

### Do I need to pay an entrance fee if Iâ€™m just buying things?

No! There is no entrance fee â€” buyers can show up on the day and enter for free.

### My babyâ€™s nap time is around the start of the event. Will people be coming later?

Yes! Parents â€” including buyers and sellers â€” are showing up later after naps. The whole time there will be items to browse, hot beverages to buy, and a play area to enjoy!

### Can I sell items for more than â‚¬2?

The spirit of the sale is to sell everything for â‚¬2 or less, to swap good quality items with community parents without breaking the bank.

You can sell a maximum of 5 items at a time over â‚¬2, and none priced over â‚¬10.  

### I thought there was a split between toddler and baby sale?

When we first announced this event, we were hosting separate toddler and baby sales. Due to community feedback and to respect our own energy as volunteer organizers, we consolidated the two sales in the afternoon only. This way, sellers with both baby and toddler clothes don't have to pay for two seller spots!


### Can I help on the day? In the future?
