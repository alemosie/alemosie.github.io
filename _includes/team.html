                    I’m an expat mama and technologist in Amsterdam West, with a passion for community building that has underscored my entire life and career. 
                    Whether serving on the board of a Dutch nonprofit to help women enter, stay, and grow in tech or packing friends into too-small city apartments, I have found purpose in bringing people together for meaningful connection and growth. 
                    When I moved to Amsterdam in 2020 — mid-pandemic — I experienced firsthand the challenges of starting a community from scratch in a foreign country. 
                    I knew that when I became a parent in 2023, I’d be facing those challenges all over again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For expat parents, community is especially important; 
                    numerous studies show that immigrant parents suffer from postnatal depression at a greater rate than local parents, in part due to lack of social support. 
                    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/368357305_The_Relationship_between_Postpartum_Depression_and_Postpartum_Support_Expatriate_and_Non-Expatriate_Comparisons">[1]</a>
                    It’s hard enough to grapple with all of the monumental emotional, physical, and social changes that come with new parenthood — but then to add on an unfamiliar language, culture, and system? 
                    With fewer family members and friends around to help? It’s no wonder that expats face an uphill battle when parenting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the Amsterdam Parent Project, I want to build community around peer-to-peer support, (em)powered by professionals. 
                    We have so much to learn from one another, so much empathy to share, and many free hands to hold your baby so that you can take that <i>one</i> moment of rest. 
                    My goal is to create a place where folks can share the full load of parenthood, because it’s a heavy burden to bear on your own.

                    I am a psychologist (PhD) and a psychotherapist with 10 years of clinical experience. 
                    Throughout my career, I have been deeply fascinated by the profound impact of motherhood on women's psychological development, particularly in how it catalyzes the awakening of their deeper selves.
                    This professional interest has been complemented and enriched by my personal journey into motherhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My own experience of becoming a mother has been transformative, to say the least.
                    It overwhelmed me with a spectrum of raw, intense emotions and presented me with challenges that, at first, seemed insurmountable.
                    The sleepless nights, the breastfeeding struggles, the balancing act between professional and personal life - all of these pushed me to my limits.
                    However, as I navigated through these challenges, I discovered reserves of strength I didn't know I possessed.
                <p>
                    This personal transformation has given me not only strength but also invaluable insights and a unique perspective that I bring to my professional practice.
                    The empathy I've developed through my own struggles allows me to connect more deeply with my clients, especially those grappling with the complexities of motherhood.
                    It has reinforced my belief in the resilience of the human spirit and the potential for growth even in the face of overwhelming circumstances.

                    I am a Postpartum Support Specialist with a background in Postpartum Nursing, and Professionally Certified Coaching. 
                    With over 15 years of experience, I’ve supported hundreds of women through the challenges of the postpartum period, offering both clinical expertise and compassionate care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Becoming a mother myself to three wonderful children—two sons and a daughter—has been my greatest blessing and the most transformative experience of my life. 
                    Like many mothers, I faced my own struggles during this journey, and it was through these personal challenges that I truly understood the value of comprehensive support during this life-changing transition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drawing on my background in postpartum nursing, transitional coaching, and my own experience as an expatriate mother, I founded BerryCare & Coaching in Amsterdam in 2022, a service dedicated to supporting new and expat parents through the physical, emotional, and social challenges of parenthood. 
                    I am deeply committed to guiding parents as they adjust to the many roles and changes that parenthood brings.

                    I’m an Amsterdam-based senior copywriter and creative strategist. 
                    I’ve worked in many fields, from fashion and beauty to sustainability and tech, but my main passion has always been building community, collecting stories and sharing them with the world. 
                    I’m always amazed by the powerful lessons that come out when people come together and share their knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had always known that having your people around you was important, but when I gave birth to my daughter, the vital role that community plays in parenting became even more clear to me. 
                    As an expat, my go-to people are often several time zones away.
                    Great for middle of the night wisdom, a little less helpful for face-to-face moments of connection. 
                    This is where I learned to lean heavily on the local parent community. 
                    I felt privileged to connect with my new peers and learn the lessons they’re passing on. 
                    Empowered by the people around me, big scary topics like sleep, solids, and keeping my sanity during the long nights suddenly felt a lot less daunting.
                <p>
                    By helping out with the Amsterdam Parent Project, I’m excited to help parents raise their voices to share their own stories. 
                    I’m looking forward to taking on the questions that wake all of us up at 3 a.m. – Is my kid breathing funny? Am I doing right by them? Did they eat enough today? – and help bring some peace of mind. 
                    All powered by our panel of experts. 
                    By building and sharing, we’re creating a stronger foundation for ourselves as parents and for our children.
