# The community asked:

## What is a kinderfysio and how could my baby benefit from it?

# Our answer:


Did you know that children’s physical therapy is completely free of charge for any child in the Netherlands under 18? Before you take advantage of this free resource, Maggie Onofri from [Kinderfysiotherapie in Amsterdam](https://kinderfysiotherapieinamsterdam.nl/english/) answers the community’s questions about what kinderfysiotherapie is and how it can support your baby’s development. If you want build your child’s confidence as they start exploring the world, read on to learn how a kinderfysio can help!

### What is a kinderfysio and what do they do?

Pediatric physical therapy (*kinderfysiotherapie* in Dutch, or *kinderfysio* for short) focuses on helping infants, toddlers, and children **improve their gross motor skills, mobility, strength, balance, and coordination**. It is designed to assist children who face developmental delays, injuries, or conditions that affect movement and physical functioning.

Even if your baby is developing normally, you could still benefit from connecting with a physical therapist. Maggie says, “Physical therapy for children goes far beyond just improving gross motor skills. It also plays a crucial role in their emotional, mental, and social development, creating a strong foundation for overall well-being.” 

A kinderfysio helps your baby build a healthy sense of self as they learn more about their physical capabilities and surroundings. “Achieving physical milestones through therapy, such as sitting, crawling, or walking, gives children a sense of accomplishment. This **boosts self-esteem and encourages them to explore their environment**,” says Maggie.

### What happens at a kinderfysio session?

At a session, the goal is to encourage your child’s motor skill mastery and confidence as they physically navigate the world. Unlike adult physical therapy — which can get pretty boring and repetitive! 😅 — kinderfysio involves a wider range of activities. You’ll see the normal exercises and stretches, but there are also play-based tasks.

“Therapy includes hands-on techniques that feel like fun but have therapeutic value,” says Maggie. “**Sessions often incorporate play**, encouraging children to interact with therapists, siblings, or peers. They often include tasks that combine movement with thinking, like problem-solving or navigating obstacle courses. This also develops social skills, like turn-taking and cooperation, and enhances cognitive abilities, such as attention, memory, and planning and improve focus.”

While the focus is always on physical development, a kinderfysio treatment acknowledges that **a baby’s social and cognitive development also play a vital role in how they move.**

### When to seek out a kinderfysio

You’re always welcome to bring your baby by for a wellness check, but there are a few cases in which Maggie recommends you reach out proactively to a kinderfysio for your baby in the first 3-6 months:

- Has difficulty with tummy time
- Consistently favors one side of their body
- Has difficulty turning their head both ways
- Has a flat spot on their head (For this, it’s best to start as soon as possible, ideally at 4 weeks. The best improvements happen between months 2-4!)
- Feels floppy (Low muscle tone or hypotonia)
- Feels unusually stiff (High muscle tone or hypertonia)
- Cries a lot, e.g. from overstimulation

Generally, if your baby doesn’t want to roll over by 6 months, crawl by 12 months or walk by 18 months, it’s a good idea to get in touch with a kinderfysio.

Physical therapy is good for your baby in a wide variety of situations; not just motor delays like “my baby won’t crawl.” If you take advantage of this free resource, know that you’re helping your baby gain confidence and sense of self as they start using their bodies to explore the world.
