alex-bio: I’m an expat mama and technologist in Amsterdam West, working for government, the tech industry, and a nonprofit to make tech a more inclusive place for women. The Amsterdam Parent Project was borne from my mission to empower every new parent who felt as helpless as I did after being given the advice many times that “it’s just a phase.” I’ve built an amazing personal community of peers and professionals to help me through, and I want all local parents to have that same support to survive and thrive in new parenthood.
